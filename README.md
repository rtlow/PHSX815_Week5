# PHSX815_Week5
Generating random samples from an arbitrary distribution using rejection

Currently, we are sampling from
`sin^2(x)/x^2`

## Example Usage
DiffractionRandom.py can be run from the command line using the `-h` flag to display usage options.
The `-Nsample` option changes the desired number of samples from the target distribution.
The `-range` option changes the range of x values to sample from.
